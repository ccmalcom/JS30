Tutorial change notes:

This was a fun one! I decided to add a countdown to a concert I am attending soon, but I hard-coded the date. Would be cool to integrate to Ticketmaster api and let users log-in to their account. The clock would then countdown to the user's closest concert. 

Also would like to utilize https://github.com/PButcher/flipdown when I get back to this

-added countdown
-changed background
-added some html elements, javascript functions
